I kept working on this through the weekend but I think its time to stop.

there's no option to turn off verbose.  

the safety algorithm isn't functioning correctly.  it just says everything is unsafe.

I feel like what I've written should work but I can't figure out where the problem is.

the blocking queue isn't flushed out right because the safety algorithm never lets anything get assigned.

I'll probably keep working on this one as Project 7
